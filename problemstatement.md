# Problem Statement
## Focus
This year, Mozilla and SPARK invite you and your learners to think about the problems posed and solved by the Internet of Things (IoT). The Internet of Things is made up of all the “smart” devices worldwide that communicate with one another - and can be controlled - over the internet. Connected devices like watches that talk to our phones and wi-fi enabled lights and thermostats are some of the objects that “live” inside the Internet of Things, an emerging field in need of diverse voices, designers, and stakeholders. High school attendees will learn how to connect devices like lights, speakers, and screens to apps that can be controlled from the web. No previous experience is necessary; mentors will offer beginner-friendly workshops as part of the event.

## Guidelines
*inspired by the [hackathon.guide](https://hackathon.guide/)*
* **Remember your hackathon audience.** In this case, it’s high schoolers who probably have no previous experience with hackathons, but are inspired by the idea of helping solve a real-world problem. One of the most important things we can do is help students make a connection between creating tech and making a difference in the world.
* **Clearly articulate the problem.** Your project should have a clear guiding question and even some suggestions for approaches to take toward a solution.
* **Manage expectations.** There will not be enough time in the hackathon to come up with a final solution. Help manage the project goals so that participants are able to feel some accomplishments.
* **Embrace failure.** Just as important, if not more, are getting through the failures. Celebrate each hurdle that is overcome and if possible, help participants reflect on what they learned.
* **Be prepared for a variety of backgrounds.** There should be a list of ready-to-go tasks that anybody could pick up with a few minutes of instruction.
