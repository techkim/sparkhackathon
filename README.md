# SPARK! Hackathon
The SPARK! Hackathon was a two-day event of learning and making that was geared toward high school students. Hosted by [St. Anne’s-Belfield School](http://stab.org) from 2016 to 2020, this event got high school students throughout the region connected to industry experts and other students who are passionate about changing the world through technology. 

The “Learnathon” on Day One included hands-on workshops and interactive presentations from professionals working in tech that are designed to get students’ creative juices flowing while they learned to create tech. The “Hackathon” on Day Two provided students the opportunity to collaborate on making tech that solve real-world problems. Mentors were on hand to help guide students through their first creation. At the end of the day, teams share their projects at the Demo Party.
