# SPARK! Hackathon
The [SPARK! Hackathon](http://spark.stab.org) is a two-day event of learning and hacking that is geared toward high school students. Hosted by [St. Anne’s-Belfield School](http://stab.org) in partnership with [Mozilla](http://learning.mozilla.org), this event gets high school students throughout the region connected to industry experts and other students who are passionate about changing the world through technology. 

The “Learnathon” on Day One includes hands-on workshops and interactive presentations from professionals working in tech that are designed to get students’ creative juices flowing while they learn to create tech. The “Hackathon” on Day Two provides students the opportunity to collaborate on creating tech that solve real-world problems. Mentors are on hand to help guide students through their first creation. At the end of the day, teams share their projects at the Demo Party.

This repository was created to share the documentation from the SPARK! Hackathon in hopes that it can be replicated. Please send let us know if we have sparked your interest at [spark@stab.org](mailto:spark@stab.org?Subject=SPARK!%20Hackathon).
